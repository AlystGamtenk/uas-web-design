              <h3>505</h3>
              <p>
                I'm going back to 505<br />
                If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br />
                In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br />
                With your hands between your thighs<br />
                Stop and wait a sec<br />
                When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you
                expect?<br />
                I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck<br />
                Or I did last time I checked<br />
                Not shy of a spark<br />
                The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the
                mark<br />
                Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark<br />
                The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start<br />
                I'm going back to 505<br />
                If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br />
                In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br />
                With your hands between your thighs<br />
                But I crumble completely when you cry<br />
                It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye<br />
                I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise<br />
                Take my hands off of your eyes too soon<br />
                I'm going back to 505<br />
                If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br />
                In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br />
                With your hands between your thighs and a smile

                I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)<br />
                Hold your hair in deep devotion (I'll be)<br />
                At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean<br />
                Now I wanna be yours<br />

                Secrets I have held in my heart<br />
                Are harder to hide than I thought<br />

              <h3>Do I Wanna Know?</h3>
              <p>
                Have you got colour in your cheeks?<br />
                Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift<br />
                The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?<br />
                Are there some aces up your sleeve?<br />
                Have you no idea that you're in deep?<br />
                I dreamt about you nearly every night this week<br />
                How many secrets can you keep?<br />
                'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you
                somehow and I play it on repeat<br />
                Until I fall asleep<br />
                Spilling drinks on my settee<br />

                (Do I wanna know?)<br />
                If this feeling flows both ways?<br />
                (Sad to see you go)<br />
                Was sort of hoping that you'd stay<br />
                (Baby, we both know)<br />
                That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you
                can't say tomorrow day<br />

                Crawling back to you<br />

                Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?<br />
                'Cause I always do<br />
                Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new<br />
                Now I've thought it through<br />

                Crawling back to you<br />

                So have you got the guts?<br />
                Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know
                what time it shuts<br />
                Simmer down and pucker up<br />
                I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of
                trying to kiss you<br />
                I don't know if you feel the same as I do<br />
                But we could be together if you wanted to<br />

                (Do I wanna know?)<br />
                If this feeling flows both ways?<br />
                (Sad to see you go)<br />
                Was sort of hoping that you'd stay<br />
                (Baby, we both know)<br />
                That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you
                can't say tomorrow day<br />

                Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)<br />

                Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a
                few)<br />
                'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)<br />
                Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for
                somebody new<br />
                Now I've thought it through<br />

                Crawling back to you<br />

                (Do I wanna know?)<br />
                If this feeling flows both ways?<br />
                (Sad to see you go)<br />
                Was sort of hoping that you'd stay<br />

                can't say tomorrow day<br />

                (Do I wanna know?)<br />
                Too busy being yours to fall<br />
                (Sad to see you go)<br />
                Ever thought of calling darling?<br />
                (Do I wanna know?)<br />
                Do you want me crawling back to you?

              <h3>Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?</h3>
              <p>
                The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time<br />
                But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side<br />
                And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your
                shoes<br />
                Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into
                you<br />

                Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your
                mind<br />
                Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply<br />
                "Why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br />
                "Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br />

                Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite<br />
                I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?<br />
                It's harder and harder to get you to listen<br />
                More I get through the gears<br />
                Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas<br />

                Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your
                mind<br />
                Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply<br />
                "Why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br />
                "Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br />

                And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I<br />
                It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time<br />
                I haven't found all I was hopin' to find<br />
                You said you gotta be up in the mornin'<br />
                Gonna have an early night<br />
                And you're startin' to bore me, baby<br />
                Why'd you only call me when you're high?<br />

                "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br />
                "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br />
                "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br />
                "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
